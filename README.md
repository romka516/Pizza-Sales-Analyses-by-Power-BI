# Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on pizza sales data from the year 2015. The project was carried out using Power BI for data visualization and analysis. Alongside the analysis, a comprehensive technical documentation in the form of [Technical Documentation.pdf](Technical%20Documentation.pdf) was prepared to provide a detailed overview of the steps taken and the insights gained from the data.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze and visualize pizza sales data from the year 2015. The data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query in Power BI, and various visualizations were created to understand sales trends, key performance indicators (KPIs), and distribution of pizza sales by category and size.

## Dataset

The primary dataset used in this project is the `pizza_sales_data.csv` file. This dataset contains information about pizza sales for the year 2015. It includes attributes such as order date, pizza category, pizza size, quantity, and revenue.

You can find the dataset in the folder of this repository: [pizza_sales_data.csv](dataset/pizza_sales_data.csv).

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** The raw pizza sales dataset was processed using Power Query in Power BI. A step-by-step process with visual illustrations can be found in the [Technical Documentation.pdf](Technical%20Documentation.pdf).

2. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Five essential KPIs were developed using explicit DAX measures: Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizza Sold, Total Orders, and Average Quantity per Order.

3. **Visualization:** A range of visualizations were crafted to address specific analytical questions:
   - Daily Trend for Total Orders
   - Monthly Pizza Orders
   - Pizza Category Sales Distribution
   - Pizza Size Sales Distribution
   - Top/Bottom 5 Pizza by Revenue/Quantity/Orders using Top N filtering
   - Utilization of slicers for Pizza Category and Time filtering

4. **Page Navigation:** Page navigation buttons were incorporated to facilitate seamless navigation between the Home page and Best/Worst Sellers pages.

5. **Inspirations:** The project drew inspiration from the [Data Tutorials]([link-to-channel](https://www.youtube.com/@datatutorials1)) YouTube channel.
